Mentality

 It is the ability to transform thought and perception. This takes the form of transforming
this reprehensible concentration of the existing external mind into that which is in the
inner mind (VUJA DE Mentality).
The ability to disrupt the existing roots and to do this in a new way is available, and this is the
reason for the nesting of wasteful and wasteful ideas, and this new roots can help the innovators
to realize the roots and complete them that no one has noticed and produce solutions that have
never been seen before. He relies on nothing
